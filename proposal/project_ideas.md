# Capstone Project - Initial Ideas

## Project Idea 1: Car Information Lookup Platform ‚≠ê (Most Preferred)

**Problem:** Car buyers, mechanics, and dealerships need quick access to comprehensive vehicle information to make informed decisions, but this data is often scattered across multiple sources or requires expensive subscriptions.

**Solution:** A web application that allows users to search for detailed vehicle specifications using VIN numbers, with user accounts to save and manage personal car collections. Users can register, authenticate, search the NHTSA database for any vehicle's complete specifications, and build their own digital garage with full CRUD functionality.

**Data Source:** NHTSA Vehicle API (free government database) for vehicle specifications, combined with custom API endpoints for user management, car collections, and profile features.

## Project Idea 2: Nutrition & Recipe Analyzer

**Problem:** Health-conscious individuals want to understand the nutritional content of recipes and meals but find it tedious to calculate calories, macros, and nutritional information manually.

**Solution:** A nutrition tracking app where users can search for food items, analyze recipe nutritional content, track daily intake, set dietary goals, and get insights about their eating patterns and nutritional balance.

**Data Source:** USDA FoodData Central API (free government database with comprehensive nutritional information for thousands of foods) combined with custom database for user profiles, meal tracking, dietary goals, and eating history.

## Project Idea 3: Book Discovery & Reading Tracker

**Problem:** Book lovers struggle to discover new books that match their interests and have difficulty tracking their reading progress and building a personal library collection.

**Solution:** A comprehensive reading platform where users can search for books by title/author/genre, get detailed book information, track reading progress, set reading goals, write personal reviews, and discover new books based on their reading history.

**Data Source:** Google Books API (free, extensive database with book details, covers, descriptions, ratings) combined with custom database for user profiles, reading lists, progress tracking, personal reviews, and reading statistics.
